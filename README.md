# city-bike---Tableau-challenge

We were tasked with creating a Dashboard and a Story in Tableau.

The subject was:
    Congratulations on your new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi BikeLinks to an external site. program, you are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicise and improve the city program.

    Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, bike data is collected, organised, and made public on the Citi Bike DataLinks to an external site. webpage.

    However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

You can download the files within this git hub to see the creation.

Here is the link to Tableau (I only have a public account for a short time so you may need to use the PDF or Power Point for your reference.)

I combined the 3 data files within Tableau using the Union function before creating the dashboards and Story boards.
